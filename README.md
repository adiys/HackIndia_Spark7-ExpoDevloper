##Implementation
1.Clone the Repository:
  cd your-repo
  
2.Install Dependencies:
npm install

3.Start Hardhat Local Network:
npx hardhat node

4.Deploy Smart Contracts:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

5.Run Local Server:
node server.js

6.Access Web Interface:
Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

### **Technologies Used**

1. **Hardhat**: Development environment for Ethereum, used for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
2. **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
3. **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for running the local server and interacting with the smart contracts.
4. **Web3.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain from the web interface.
5. **Ethereum**: Blockchain platform for deploying and executing smart contracts.
6. **Local Ethereum Network (Hardhat Network)**: Local blockchain environment for testing and development.
7. **Express.js** (if used): Web framework for building the local server.
8. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for creating the web interface to interact with the smart contracts.
9. **MetaMask** (optional for external interactions): Browser extension for managing Ethereum accounts and interacting with dApps.
10. **Git**: Version control system for managing source code.
11. **Arduino**: Integrating Web3 technology into an Arduino-based home automation system allows for enhanced control and automation through blockchain interactions. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to implement Web3 with Arduino.
These technologies together enable the development, deployment, and interaction with smart contracts in a Web3-enabled smart home automation system.
12. Embedded System.
13. Internet of Things. 

## Use Case

Suppose you have a smart contract that controls the status of various devices in your home. The smart contract can be set up to receive commands or trigger actions based on certain conditions. For instance, you can have a smart contract that:

### - Monitors energy consumption and automatically adjusts settings based on thresholds.
### - Issues alerts if certain conditions are met, like a gas leak detection.
### - Allows for decentralized control of devices, where multiple users can interact with the system through blockchain transactions.
